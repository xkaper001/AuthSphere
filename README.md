# Identification and Authentication Failure (OWASP TOP 10)

## Problem Statement
Existing systems for identification and authentication often fall short in real-time detection of failures and proactive mitigation. This creates vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit, leading to data breaches and compromised user accounts. The lack of comprehensive tools for live monitoring and failure logging exacerbates this issue, leaving organizations with reactive rather than proactive measures.

## Introduction
Identification and authentication processes are fundamental to ensuring secure access to systems and resources. These mechanisms verify the identity of users or entities before granting access to sensitive data or services. However, failures in identification and authentication pose significant security risks, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise.

Authentication failures can occur due to various reasons, such as incorrect credentials, expired passwords, brute force attacks, or system misconfigurations. Common symptoms of these failures include "invalid login," "authentication denied," or "failed login attempts." Identifying these failures is critical for preventing malicious activities and strengthening system security.

The project titled "Identification and Authentication Failure" addresses security vulnerabilities related to authentication processes by building a comprehensive web analyzer. The solution utilizes Dart for a frontend application, Python FastAPI for a backend API, and React for additional functional components like logging and handling authentication failures. This report documents the development process and implementation strategies while analyzing the results and proposing improvements for future work
